# Authentication Integration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate authentication with the existing Novel2Manga system.

## Overview

The authentication system has been successfully integrated with all existing API endpoints to ensure user data isolation and secure access to resources.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Authentication Utility (`src/utils/api-auth.ts`)

Created a comprehensive authentication utility that provides:

- `getAuthenticatedUser()` - Effect-based authentication with bypass support
- `withAuth()` - Higher-order function to wrap API handlers with authentication
- `runWithAuth()` - Utility to run Effects with authentication

### 2. API Protection Utilities (`src/utils/api-protection.ts`)

Created protection utilities that define:

- `PROTECTED_ROUTES` - List of routes requiring authentication
- `PUBLIC_ROUTES` - List of public routes
- `isProtectedRoute()` - Check if route needs authentication
- `createAuthRequiredResponse()` - Graceful error handling for unauthenticated requests
- `validateDebugAccess()` - Restrict debug endpoints to development

### 3. Updated API Endpoints

All job and novel-related endpoints have been updated to require authentication:

#### Novel Management

- `POST /api/novel` - Novel upload with user association
- `GET/POST /api/novel/db` - Novel database operations with user filtering
- `GET/POST /api/novel/storage` - Novel storage with user association

#### Job Management

- `POST /api/analyze` - Text analysis with user ownership validation
- `POST /api/analyze/chunk` - Chunk analysis with job ownership validation
- `GET /api/jobs/[jobId]` - Job details with ownership validation
- `POST /api/jobs/[jobId]/resume` - Job resumption with ownership validation
- `GET /api/jobs/[jobId]/status` - Job status with ownership validation
- `GET /api/jobs/[jobId]/events` - Job events SSE with ownership validation
- `GET /api/jobs/[jobId]/token-usage` - Token usage with ownership validation
- `POST /api/resume` - Job resume with novel ownership validation

#### Rendering

- `POST /api/render` - Single page rendering with job ownership validation
- `POST /api/render/batch` - Batch rendering with job ownership validation
- `GET /api/render/status/[jobId]` - Render status with job ownership validation
- `GET /api/render/[episodeNumber]/[pageNumber]` - Image serving with job ownership validation

#### Layout Generation

- `POST /api/layout/generate` - Layout generation with job ownership validation

#### Export and Sharing

- `POST /api/export` - Export creation with job ownership validation
- `GET /api/export` - Export download with output ownership validation
- `GET /api/export/zip/[jobId]` - ZIP export with job ownership validation
- `POST /api/share` - Share creation with job ownership validation

#### Job Details

- `GET /api/job/[id]` - Job details with ownership validation

### 4. User Data Isolation

All endpoints now implement proper user data isolation:

- Jobs are filtered by `userId` to ensure users only see their own jobs
- Novels are filtered by `userId` to ensure users only see their own novels
- All job operations validate ownership before allowing access
- Database queries include user ID filtering

### 5. Database Integration

The existing database schema already included `userId` columns with proper foreign key constraints:

- `novels.userId` references `user.id`
- `jobs.userId` references `user.id`
- `outputs.userId` references `user.id`
- `storageFiles.userId` references `user.id`

### 6. Migration Support

Created migration script (`scripts/migrate-existing-data.ts`) to handle existing data:

- Associates existing 'anonymous' records with users
- Creates migration user if no users exist
- Provides logging and error handling for migration process

### 7. Error Handling

Implemented graceful error handling for authentication:

- 401 Unauthorized for missing authentication
- 403 Forbidden for insufficient permissions
- Helpful error messages with login URLs
- Consistent error response format

### 8. Development Support

- Debug endpoints restricted to development environment
- Authentication bypass available in development with `ALLOW_ADMIN_BYPASS=true`
- Comprehensive logging for authentication events

## Security Measures

1. **User Data Isolation**: All API endpoints validate user ownership before allowing access
2. **Authentication Required**: All protected endpoints require valid user sessions
3. **Graceful Error Handling**: Unauthenticated requests receive helpful error messages
4. **Development Restrictions**: Debug endpoints disabled in production
5. **Input Validation**: All endpoints validate user ownership of referenced resources

## Testing

All authentication integration has been tested with:

- Unit tests for authentication utilities
- Integration tests for job management with user isolation
- Integration tests for authentication flow
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows

## Migration Path

For existing deployments:

1. Run the migration script to associate existing data with users
2. Update environment variables to include authentication settings
3. Deploy the updated code with authentication requirements
4. Verify all endpoints require proper authentication

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies the following requirements:

- **5.1, 5.2, 5.3**: User data isolation and job association
- **1.6**: Authentication requirements for protected routes
- **5.4, 5.5**: User ownership validation
- **10.3, 10.5**: Graceful handling of unauthenticated requests

All existing functionality is preserved while adding comprehensive authentication and user data isolation.
