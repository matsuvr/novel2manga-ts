# Feature Specification: OpenNext„ÉªCloudflareÂâäÈô§„Å®Á¥îÁ≤ãNext.jsÔºãSQLite3ÁßªË°å

**Feature Branch**: `001-oepnnext-cloudflare-next`  
**Created**: 2025-09-08  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "oepnnext, cloudflare„ÇíÂÆåÂÖ®„Å´ÂâäÈô§„Åó„ÄÅÁ¥îÁ≤ã„Å™Next.jsÂÆüË£Ö„Å´„Åô„Çã„ÄÇDB„ÅØSQLite3"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature description: Remove OpenNext/Cloudflare, migrate to pure Next.js with SQLite3
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: OpenNext removal, Cloudflare removal, pure Next.js implementation, SQLite3 database
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Define migration scenarios and testing requirements
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved in migration)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want to migrate the application from OpenNext/Cloudflare deployment to a pure Next.js implementation with SQLite3 database, so that I can simplify the deployment architecture and reduce dependency on third-party services while maintaining all existing functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current OpenNext/Cloudflare deployment is running, **When** the migration is completed, **Then** all existing user-facing features must work identically to the previous implementation
2. **Given** data exists in the current system, **When** the migration is performed, **Then** all data must be successfully migrated to SQLite3 without data loss
3. **Given** the new pure Next.js implementation, **When** deployed, **Then** the application must start successfully and serve all routes
4. **Given** the new SQLite3 database, **When** the application runs, **Then** all database operations must function correctly

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the database schema differs between Cloudflare D1 and SQLite3?
- How does system handle large dataset migration from Cloudflare to local SQLite3?
- What happens when Cloudflare-specific features (like KV storage, R2) are removed?
- How does system handle environment-specific configurations during migration?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain all existing user-facing functionality after migration
- **FR-002**: System MUST successfully migrate all existing data from Cloudflare D1 to SQLite3  
- **FR-003**: System MUST remove all OpenNext dependencies and configurations
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove all Cloudflare-specific bindings and configurations
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement SQLite3 as the primary database
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain data integrity during migration process
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide equivalent performance characteristics after migration
- **FR-008**: System MUST support all existing API endpoints and routes

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle migration of [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific data types are stored in Cloudflare KV/R2 that need SQLite3 equivalent?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST complete migration within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable downtime window not specified]
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific performance metrics are critical?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Data**: All user account information and preferences currently stored in Cloudflare D1
- **Application Data**: All application-specific data including novels, manga, and conversion results
- **Configuration Data**: Environment-specific configurations currently managed by Cloudflare
- **Migration Log**: Record of all data migration activities for audit and rollback purposes
