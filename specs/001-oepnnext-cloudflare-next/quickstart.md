# Migration Quickstart Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for migrating from OpenNext/Cloudflare to pure Next.js with SQLite3.

## Prerequisites

### Before Migration

1. **Backup Current Data**

   ```bash
   # Export current database (if you are using Cloudflare D1, use wrangler d1 export locally)
   # If you already migrated to local SQLite, simply copy the DB file:
   cp ./database/novel2manga.db ./backup/backup.sql

   This quickstart has been archived. Cloudflare/OpenNext-specific migration steps were removed.

   If you need the original quickstart content, see `archive/cloudflare-legacy/specs/001-oepnnext-cloudflare-next-quickstart.md` or the git history.
